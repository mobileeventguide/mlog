= MLog

My little logger wrapper. Will give you easy access to logger functions with
class and caller method info.

== Usage

=== Logging

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'mlog'
  
you can then use the methods: elog,wlog,ilog,dlog

where elog is like: 
      logger.error "text if you like"
wlog is like: 
      logger.warn "text if you like"
ilog is like: 
      logger.info "text if you like" 
dlog is like: 
      logger.debug "text if you like"

=== Configuration
  
after require, just do some:

  MLog::Configuration.add_log_path :file, Rails.root.join('log/mlog_test.log').to_s

fyi: logs are rotated 'daily'

=== Tracing

What might come in handy if you have no clue whats going on in somebodies code:

  mlog_enable_trace
  #...some code
  mlog_disable_trace
  
You can encapsule code like that and then get flodded with all the 'calls'
that happen in the vm.

/^(call)/ is the default regexp, but there's more fun stuff to trace out there: returns, sends, ...


Have phun kidz!
